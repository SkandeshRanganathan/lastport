        To be honest, my academic journey can be neatly summarized by that table. I deviated from the conventional path by not taking my board exams until my 12th standard, a decision that inadvertently instilled a sense of nervousness among my peers due to my age.<br><br> While I initially approached this unconventional route without much trepidation, the mounting pressure gradually began to take its toll.

        However, every situation presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Despite the apprehension that crept in, my primary focus remained steadfast on the competitive exams that followed the boards.<br><br> While I harbored doubts about my abilities, particularly concerning NEET, I poured my heart and soul into the second attempt at JEE. Regrettably, the results didn't quite measure up to the level I had hoped for.<br><br>
        
        Despite the setbacks and uncertainties, my journey is a testament to resilience and perseverance. It's a reminder that challenges, though daunting, are surmountable with dedication and hard work.<br><br>
